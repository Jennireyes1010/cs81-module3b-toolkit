I predict the double(n) function will return my input as its doubled value, I will use 8 so I expect 16 as my result. 

I predict this function will return my input as false, my input is 7 and this function reports whether a number is even or not.

I predict my result will return aa '81', this function will return my run my input of 9 and multiply it by 9. 

I predict my result to be 216, this function will mutiply my input of 6 by itself a total of three times. 

I predict my output to be false, this function will divide my input of 4 by 2, since it will come out complete with no remainder it will report as not an odd number.

I predict the result to be 63, this function multiplys two inputs, I did 9,7 for this test.
